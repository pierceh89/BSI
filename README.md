# BSI
B-Spline Surface Interpolation

BSI is a simple tool of interpolation for integral (not rational) B-Spline Surface.

Given data points in the form of _(m \* n)_ and degree of curves _(k,l)_ for each direction, control points of B-Spline surface lying on given points can be obtained. Additionally, parametrization for given data points and generating knot sequence is needed and it can be done by using a provided function or user-defined function.

The example code is __main.cpp__. I hope anybody find this useful.
